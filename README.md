# Global Superstore Dashboard

### Project Overview

This project aims to provide insight into the sales performance of an online global retailer. This will be done by analyzing and drawing out meaningful insight from the Superstore dataset which would aid management in making informed decisions to improve performance and profitability.

### Data Sources

### Data Cleaning/Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:

1. Data loading, inspection and transforming
2. Data cleaning missing values to improve column quality to 100%
3. Data formating

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer the following key questions:

- Question 1.
  a) What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?
  b) For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product?

- Question 2.
  a) Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States.

- Question 3.
  a) Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African countries?
  b) What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance? You might want to investigate shipping costs and the average discount as potential root causes.

- Question 4.
  a) Identify the product subcategory that is the least profitable in Southeast Asia.
  Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar(Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
  b) Is there a specific country in Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should stop offering the subcategory identified in 4a?

- Question 5.
  a) Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis, discard the cities with less than 10 Orders.
  b) Why is this city’s average profit so low?

- Question 6.
  a) Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?
